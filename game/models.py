class Game(models.Model):
    """
    This defines the board state (and metadata) for a tic-tac-toe game.

    The board is modeled a 9 character string:
        'X' or 'O' means the space is played.
        ' ' (space) means the space is empty.

    We also keep track of the time the game was created and last updated,
    just in case we want to add "recent games" or a game list of some form.

    In addition, it includes the player types. Since this is somewhat
    insulated from the view layer of the application, we should be
    generic about the player types and not make assumptions about
    what the UI can support -- for instance, we should be able
    to support two human players, or potentially two computer players
    (although the latter would be quite dull).

    We also need to support different computer player types. Each
    player field (player_x or player_o) is a string that specifies
    either "human" or a player object type.

    Note right now we aren't robust against degenerate cases --
    we don't prevent you from saving board states that are impossible
    given the game rules.
